# Release Checklist

This document covers the unified release workflow for stable and nightly desktop releases.

## What the workflow does

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - push tag matching `v*.*.*` for stable releases
  - scheduled nightly check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` for either channel
- Runs quality gates first: lint, typecheck, test.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel for both channels:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- Publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Stable tags with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain stable `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
  - Nightly runs are always GitHub prereleases and never marked latest.
  - Automatically generated release notes are pinned to the previous tag in the same channel, so stable compares to the previous stable tag and nightly compares to the previous nightly tag.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml`, `nightly*.yml`, and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `456code`) with OIDC trusted publishing from the same workflow file:
  - stable releases publish npm dist-tag `latest`
  - nightly releases publish npm dist-tag `nightly`
  - publishing runs through `node apps/server/scripts/cli.ts publish`, which builds one temporary
    npm package containing the private Cartographer runtime, validates that exact tarball in clean
    npm and pnpm consumers, and passes the same tarball to `npm publish`
  - the Cartographer payload contains the analysis/query engine plus CLI and MCP entries; it does
    not contain the retired browser workbench or a static Atlas web bundle
- Deploys the hosted web app to Vercel only after a release is published:
  - stable releases are aliased to the `latest` hosted app channel
  - nightly releases are aliased to the `nightly` hosted app channel
- Resolves required public client configuration from three Clerk variables in the
  `production` environment and stops the release if any are empty.
- Signing is optional and auto-detected per platform from secrets.

## Release public configuration

The workflow job currently named `relay_public_config` is the release's fail-closed public-config
producer. It reads these GitHub Actions variables from the `production` environment:

- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`
- `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`

If any value is empty, the job exits and blocks desktop builds, CLI publishing, and hosted web
deployment. Its outputs contain only those three Clerk values; it does not produce a relay URL or a
tracing configuration artifact. The external relay deployable is retired, and the release workflow
does not deploy one. Relay schemas and client-runtime utilities that remain in the workspace are
supported client compatibility surfaces, not release infrastructure.

## Windows WSL prebuild

CI builds a Linux x64 `node-pty` binary in `build_wsl_node_pty`, uploads it as the
`wsl-node-pty-x64` artifact, and makes the Windows matrix entry download it. Windows packaging
always passes that binary with `--wsl-prebuild`; a missing CI artifact therefore fails the Windows
release path instead of silently shipping a broken WSL backend.

Local desktop packaging is intentionally less strict. If neither `--wsl-prebuild <path>` nor
`T3CODE_DESKTOP_WSL_PREBUILD=<path>` is supplied, the packager logs a warning and continues. The
resulting Windows package does not contain the Linux `pty.node` required by its WSL backend.

## Hosted web app release deployment

The hosted app is intentionally not deployed by Vercel's Git integration. The
web project disables automatic Git deployments in `apps/web/vercel.ts` via
`git.deploymentEnabled: false`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` deploys the
web app with Vercel CLI after the GitHub Release succeeds.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

Optional GitHub Actions variables:

- `VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG`: overrides the Vercel CLI scope when the team slug is preferred over the `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secret.
- `T3CODE_WEB_ROUTER_URL`: defaults to `https://app.t3.codes`.
- `T3CODE_WEB_LATEST_DOMAIN`: defaults to `latest.app.t3.codes`.
- `T3CODE_WEB_NIGHTLY_DOMAIN`: defaults to `nightly.app.t3.codes`.

Configured Vercel domain prerequisites:

- `app.t3.codes`: the router domain users open, updated by stable releases.
- `latest.app.t3.codes`: channel alias updated by stable releases.
- `nightly.app.t3.codes`: channel alias updated by nightly releases.

These names are workflow and router defaults, not proof that DNS or Vercel domain ownership is
configured. Before deployment, configure the three domains in Vercel and DNS, or override the
workflow variables with domains already attached to the project.

The router domain uses `apps/web/vercel.ts` routes. Users opt into a channel by
visiting `/__456code/channel?channel=latest` or
`/__456code/channel?channel=nightly`; the router stores the
`456code_web_channel` cookie and rewrites future requests on `app.t3.codes` to
the matching channel alias.

The release deploy job rewrites release package versions before upload so the
hosted app's About panel renders the release version. Stable deploys alias the
same deployment to both the `latest` channel and the router domain so the router
rules stay current. Nightly deploys only alias the `nightly` channel. The job
also passes `VITE_HOSTED_APP_CHANNEL=latest|nightly`, which renders the hosted
update track selector in the About panel. Changing the selector navigates
through `/__456code/channel` on the router domain so the user's channel cookie is
updated before redirecting to the hosted app root.

One-time Vercel dashboard setup:

1. Confirm the web project root directory remains `apps/web`.
2. Add the three domains above to the web project.
3. Disable automatic Git deployments in the dashboard if desired; the committed
   `vercel.ts` setting is the source-of-truth, but disconnecting Git in the
   dashboard is also safe.
4. Run one stable release deployment, or manually alias the current stable
   deployment, so `app.t3.codes` points at a deployment containing the router
   rules in `apps/web/vercel.ts`. Future stable releases keep this alias current.

## Nightly builds

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - scheduled check every three hours
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- Runs the same desktop quality gates and artifact matrix as the tagged release flow.
- Publishes a GitHub prerelease only:
  - tag format: `nightly-vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run_number>`
  - release name includes the short commit SHA
  - `make_latest` is always `false`
- Uses the next stable patch version as the nightly base. For example, `0.0.17` produces nightlies on `0.0.18-nightly.*`.
- Publishes Electron auto-update metadata to the dedicated `nightly` updater channel, so desktop users can opt into that track independently from stable.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `456code`) to the `nightly` npm dist-tag using the same nightly version.
- Does not commit version bumps back to `main`.

## Server self-update release invariant

Connected servers update to the client's exact version, not to an npm dist-tag. Every released
desktop or hosted client version must therefore have a matching `456code@<version>` package available on
npm before users can receive that client.

The workflow enforces this ordering:

1. `publish_cli` publishes the exact stable or nightly version to npm.
2. `release` depends on `publish_cli` before exposing desktop artifacts in GitHub Releases.
3. `deploy_web` depends on `release` before moving the hosted channel to the new client.

Preserve these dependencies when changing the release graph. Publishing a client first would leave
the **Update server** action targeting a package version that does not exist yet.

For a release smoke test, confirm `npm view 456code@<version> version` returns the expected version, then
connect the new client to a server on the previous version and verify that the update action
reconnects to the matching server. Test one automatic path and the manual or desktop-managed
guidance when those environments are available.

## Desktop auto-update notes

- Runtime updater: `electron-updater` in `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Temporary private-repo auth workaround:
  - set `T3CODE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN`) in the desktop app runtime environment.
  - the app forwards it as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` request header for updater HTTP calls.
- Required release assets for updater:
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, plus macOS `.zip` for Squirrel.Mac update payloads)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - `electron-updater` reads `latest-mac.yml` on stable and `nightly-mac.yml` on nightly, for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
  - The workflow merges the per-arch mac manifests into one channel-specific mac manifest before publishing the GitHub Release.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

The workflow publishes the CLI through `node apps/server/scripts/cli.ts publish` after aligning the
package version to the release tag version. The server build first builds Cartographer core and the
web client. The publish command then creates a temporary package, embeds the private
Cartographer package and its lockfile-backed production dependency closure, runs `npm pack`, and
validates the exact archive through installed CLI, MCP, Architecture-query, and server entrypoints.
Only that validated archive is passed to `npm publish`; the live workspace manifest and build
outputs are not rewritten for packaging.

Checklist:

1. Confirm npm org/user owns package `456code` (or rename package first if needed).
2. In npm package settings, configure Trusted Publisher:
   - Provider: GitHub Actions
   - Repository: `ggfincke/456code`
   - Workflow file: `release.yml`
   - Environment (if used): match your npm trusted publishing config
3. Ensure npm account and org policies allow trusted publishing for the package.
4. Create release tag `vX.Y.Z` and push; workflow will:
   - set `apps/server/package.json` version to `X.Y.Z`
   - build Cartographer core + web + server
   - run the CLI publish command with `--tag latest`
5. Nightly runs from the same workflow file use the same CLI publish command with `--tag nightly`.

## 1) Dry-run release without signing

Use this first to validate the release pipeline.

1. Confirm no signing secrets are required for this test.
2. Create a test tag:
   - `git tag v0.0.0-test.1`
   - `git push origin v0.0.0-test.1`
3. Wait for `.github/workflows/release.yml` to finish.
4. Verify the GitHub Release contains all platform artifacts.
5. Download each artifact and sanity-check installation on each OS.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (base64-encoded provisioning profile)

Required repository variables:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. Create an explicit App ID for `com.ggfincke.456code`.
3. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate and a compatible provisioning profile for that
   App ID.
4. Export the certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
5. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
6. Base64-encode the provisioning profile and store it as `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
7. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the
   10-character Apple Developer Team ID.
8. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
9. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
10. Re-run a tag release and confirm macOS artifacts are signed and notarized.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.
- The workflow decodes `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` and validates it with `security cms`. The
  decoded profile is no longer passed to the desktop packager; the check only fails the job early
  when the stored secret is malformed.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Re-run a tag release and confirm Windows installer is signed.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Ensure `main` is green in CI.
2. Bump app version as needed.
3. Create release tag: `vX.Y.Z`.
4. Push tag.
5. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - all matrix builds pass
   - `publish_cli` publishes the exact release version before the release job
   - release job uploads expected files
6. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Apple secrets plus `APPLE_TEAM_ID` are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.ggfincke.456code`.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with secrets removed to confirm unsigned path still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.
